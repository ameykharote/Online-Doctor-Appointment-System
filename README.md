# Online-Doctor-Appointment-System
Created a system which helped the doctors to manage their appointments and schedule. 
Patients could check doctor’s schedule and book an appointment, and they could also check their medical history.
Doctors would initially create their schedule at different hospitals and the patients would check their schedule and book an appointment accordingly.
As it was my last year diploma project currently I dont have the code with me.
Technology used: Java Server Pages, Servlet, Java language, MySql, Eclipse, and Apache Tomcat Server.
