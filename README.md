# Online-Doctor-Appointment-System
Created a system which helped the doctors to manage their appointments and schedule. 
Patients could check doctorâ€™s schedule and book an appointment, and they could also check their medical history.
Doctors would initially create their schedule at different hospitals and the patients would check their schedule and book an appointment accordingly.
As it was my last year diploma project currently I dont have the code with me.
Technology used: Java Server Pages, Servlet, Java language, MySql, Eclipse, and Apache Tomcat Server.


Note: Currently due to some programming error the code is not available, the team is trying to upload the code asap.
